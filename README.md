### Purpose and Scope
The project focuses on forcasting volatility of financial time series and detecting atypical market behavior, using advanced path signature techniques.

### Key Concepts Covered:
Lead-Lag Transformation: Enhances temporal resolution by introducing quadratic variations in time series.
Path Signature used to encode time-series data into a higher-dimensional space for complex pattern representation.
Volatility Metrics: 
Unsupervised Classification: 

### Repository Structure:
- main.py: Python file to run the code
