### Purpose and Scope
The project focuses on forcasting volatility of financial time series and detecting atypical market behavior, using advanced path signature techniques.

### Key Concepts Covered:
The project integrates the following advanced concepts:

Lead-Lag Transformation: Enhances temporal resolution by introducing quadratic variations in time series.
Path Signature: Encodes time-series data into a higher-dimensional space for complex pattern representation.
Volatility Metrics: Measures and forecasts market fluctuations.
Unsupervised Classification: Identifies anomalies without relying on labeled data.
