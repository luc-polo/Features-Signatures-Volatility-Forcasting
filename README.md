### Purpose and Scope
The project focuses on forcasting volatility of financial time series and detecting atypical market behavior, using advanced path signature techniques.

### Key Concepts Covered:
Lead-Lag Transformation: Enhances temporal resolution by introducing quadratic variations in time series.
Path Signature used to encode time-series data into a higher-dimensional space for complex pattern representation.
Volatility Metrics: 
Unsupervised Classification: 

### Repository Structure:
- main.py: The main script to execute the project pipeline, from data preprocessing to anomaly detection and visualization.
- Script: Folder containing Python files used in main.py
  - data_loader.py: Handles data collection and loading from external sources (e.g., Yahoo Finance).
  - data_processing.py: Conducts feature engineering, normalization, and lead-lag transformation.
  - data_visualization.py: Contains utilities for visualizing anomalies, volatility trends, and market behaviors.
- Project Plan.md: A detailed document outlining the development process, methodologies, and objectives.
