Advice from a pro quant:

Make sure the code is clean and elegant. Input, model, and output should be separated and should each be runnable as one line of code. 
No absolute paths should exist in the input or output--only in a config file, stored as a variable.
In fact, it should be the only thing a user would have to change to run the code (as long as they have the data).

1. Statistical Arbitrage Trading Strategy Development
Develop a pairs trading or statistical arbitrage model to detect price inefficiencies between correlated assets. Use time-series analysis techniques like cointegration and mean reversion to generate signals, backtest them on historical data, and implement automated trading based on live market feeds.

4. Portfolio Optimization Using Mean-Variance and Black-Litterman Models

Construct an optimized portfolio using traditional mean-variance optimization and the Black-Litterman model. Combine historical data with investor views to balance risk and returns, backtest performance, and account for transaction costs in rebalancing under varying market conditions.

6. Volatility Trading Strategy with VIX Futures

Develop a volatility trading strategy using VIX futures and options to hedge or speculate on market volatility. Analyze historical VIX data and implement models to capture periods of rising or falling volatility, backtest the strategy, and measure its effectiveness under different market regimes.
