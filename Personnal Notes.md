Advice from a pro quant:

Make sure the code is clean and elegant. Input, model, and output should be separated and should each be runnable as one line of code. 
No absolute paths should exist in the input or output--only in a config file, stored as a variable.
In fact, it should be the only thing a user would have to change to run the code (as long as they have the data).
