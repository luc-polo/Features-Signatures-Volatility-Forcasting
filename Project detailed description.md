### 1. Normalized Time

data["Normalized Time"] = (data.index - data.index[0]) / (data.index[-1] - data.index[0])

Purpose: Normalizes the time index into a range [0,1]
This standardization ensures that time is independent of the original scale (e.g., seconds, minutes, or days) and becomes unitless.
Useful for models and computations that are sensitive to feature scales, allowing time to contribute proportionally to other features.
Why it is important:
Some machine learning and signature-based models assume features are on similar scales for numerical stability.
It avoids issues caused by the large range of time values (e.g., timestamps or tick indices).

### 2. Logarithm of Mid-Price (Normalized Mid-Price)

data["Mid-Price"] = 0.5 * (data["High"] + data["Low"])
data["Normalized Mid-Price"] = (np.log(data["Mid-Price"]) - np.mean(np.log(data["Mid-Price"]))) / np.std(np.log(data["Mid-Price"]))

Purpose:
Mid-Price Calculation:
The mid-price is computed as the average of the high and low prices, which provides a fair representation of the asset's central value during a time interval.
Logarithmic Transformation:
Taking the logarithm converts multiplicative changes (e.g., percent increases/decreases) into additive changes. This is particularly useful in financial data where prices often change exponentially rather than linearly.
Normalization:
The mid-price is normalized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This ensures the feature is unitless and comparable to other features.
Why it is important:
Logarithmic transformation helps capture proportional price movements, which are more informative in financial analysis than absolute price levels.
Normalization reduces the dominance of large price scales in the data, preventing biases in downstream computations or models.


### 3. Spread (Normalized Spread)

data["Spread"] = data["High"] - data["Low"]
data["Normalized Spread"] = (data["Spread"] - np.mean(data["Spread"])) / np.std(data["Spread"])

Purpose:
Spread Calculation:
The spread is the difference between the high and low prices, representing the asset's price range during a specific time interval.
Normalization:
Normalizing the spread removes the influence of absolute scale, making it easier to compare across different time intervals or assets.
Why it is important:
The spread reflects market volatility or uncertainty during a specific time period.
A normalized spread allows models to focus on the variability in spreads rather than their absolute magnitudes, which may differ across datasets.


### 4. Imbalance

data["Imbalance"] = (data["Volume"] - data["Volume"].shift(1)) / (data["Volume"] + data["Volume"].shift(1))
data["Imbalance"] = data["Imbalance"].fillna(0)
Purpose:
Imbalance Calculation:
Measures the relative difference in trading volume between consecutive time steps.
Provides insight into whether there is more buying or selling pressure at a given time.
Handling Missing Values:
The first row will have a missing value due to the .shift(1) operation. Filling this value with 0 ensures the column remains usable.
Why it is important:
Volume imbalance is a key indicator of market sentiment (e.g., strong buying or selling activity).
Normalizing the imbalance helps standardize the feature across different time intervals or datasets.


### Overall Rationale for These Transformations
Standardization and Normalization:
Features are normalized to unitless scales with mean 0 and standard deviation 1, making them suitable for numerical models and reducing the risk of overfitting.
Feature Engineering for Financial Data:
Each transformation extracts meaningful insights from raw financial data:
Time standardization captures temporal patterns.
Mid-price and spread reflect price movements and volatility.
Imbalance captures trading activity dynamics.
Improving Model Interpretability and Stability:
By transforming and normalizing the data, downstream tasks like machine learning, regression, or signature computations become more robust and interpretable.
